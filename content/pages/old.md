# High school work

## My materials

- [Properties of 2020](/files/handouts/M0-prop2020.pdf): I scoured OEIS and compiled a list of properties of 2020. It's amusing but not very useful.
- [AIME Strategies](/files/handouts/M0-aime.pdf): I compiled a list of strategies for the AIME.
- [Diagram Perturbation](/files/handouts/M2-perturb.pdf): Slick geometric transformation problems that feel like you’re building something on top of the existing figure.
- [Hidden Gems](/files/handouts/M2-gems.pdf): Some problems that don’t get the love they deserve; many are taken from David Altizio’s collection.
- [Unorthodox Problems](/files/handouts/M3-unorthodox.pdf): A collection of fun problems.
- [Diophantine Equations](/files/handouts/M3-diophantine.pdf): Some techniques to solve diophantines, like modular arithmetic, inequalities, etc.
- [Invariants](/files/handouts/M3-invariants.pdf): How to use quantities that don't change to solve problems.
- [Roots of Unity Filter](/files/handouts/filter.pdf): A neat algebraic trick with applications in combinatorics and number theory. Co-written with Raymond Feng.
- [LaTeX Basics](/files/handouts/I0-latex.pdf): Fundamentals of LaTeX like common commands.


## Euclid's Orchard

Over COVID, I wrote handouts with some of my friends, and a lot of people liked them! I especially recommend the polynomial/trig handouts.

- [One Page Summaries](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-onepagers.pdf), me: A project to condense topics into one page each. Unfortunately, I never finished it.
- [Recursion](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-recursion.pdf), Jeff Chen: Intro to forming and solving recursions.
- [Modular Arithmetic](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-mods.pdf), me: Intro to mods.
- [Sequence and Series](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-sequences.pdf), nikenissan: Intro to arithmetic, geometric, telescoping, and recursive sequences.
- [Polynomials](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-polynomials.pdf), naman12 and me: Comprehensive guide to polynomials.
- [Trigonometry](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-trig.pdf), naman12 and me: Comprehensive guide to trig techniques.
- [Group Theory](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-grouptheory.pdf), Emma Cardwell and Matthew Ho: Intro to group theory; I converted their class slides to notes.
