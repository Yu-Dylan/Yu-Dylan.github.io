I want to write more, so I created this nice site so I would be incentivized to do so. The site is inspired by [Brandon Wang](https://br-wa.github.io/) and [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/).

My experience with using Windsurf to vibe-code this site was pretty smooth. I started with Sonnet 4.5, and it was good at recreating the example images I gave it, but not so good at thinking from scratch (LLMs aren't very imaginative!). It was also [terrible at fixing simple bugs](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aIvHf8vsWBM), but switching to Opus 4.1 (Thinking) helped (probably because it read more files and understood the structure more). Seems that models have a bad problem with context retrieval --- they don't really know when they don't know things, since they have all these pre-training memories floating around that make them think they know!

Despite these problems, I was able to build this site in just a few hours. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/Yu-Dylan/Yu-Dylan.github.io), but I made no real effort to review it so I wouldn't trust it.
