# About me
Hello! I'm Dylan, a freshman at MIT. Broadly, I'm interested in machine learning, quantitative trading, and discrete mathematics. I plan to pursue a double major in Math and CS.

As a high schooler, I was heavily interested in teaching and outreach, especially in mathematics. Some of my teaching experience is listed on this page.

Aside from academics, I enjoy coding (web dev, optimizing my computer), basketball, playing poker, and spending time in nature.

## Things I was involved in
- [Math Advance](https://mathadvance.org/) and [MAST](https://mast.mathadvance.org/)
- [NICE Contest](https://www.nicecontest.xyz/)
- [Vibrant Learning](https://vibrantlearning.github.io/)
- ASE Math Club
- [Little MD](https://littlemeddegree.wixsite.com/medcamp)
